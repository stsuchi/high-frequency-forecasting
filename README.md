Time series forecasting techniques have gone through robust developments for about the past 100 years in finance and econometrics. The foundational elements of the techniques are still effective in a traditional framework, but limited in detecting more subtle patterns in this digital age with big data technology. Today, companies collect data for rather somewhat irrational usersâ€™ behavior and often face a need to calibrate the incoming data on a (near-) real time basis. It is often the case that data exhibit multiple seasonality in high frequency (0-30 minutes) to a varying extent for a long time, which traditional approaches have hardly dealt with in the past.  To analyze such a type of data, I developed and applied two new approaches. 1) dynamic regression - use all the relevant variables including fourier terms as seasonality factors and apply autoregressive integrated moving average to the residuals of the model 2) apply machine learning algorithm (gradient boosting in my case) with hour of day, day of week and their trigonometric counterparts as seasonality factors. Both of these techniques not only make forecasting possible but also has higher accuracy. The techniques add value and confidence in capacity planning and anomaly detection in client-facing business settings.
